# Working with Prefabs

To author streamable prefabs you can work with managing collections within Blender.

To mark a collection as a prefab, you can mark it as `Include in Export` like the image below. To set a prefab which is not a sub prefab and will have the same name as the blend file, you can turn on `Set This Collection As The Main Scene`

**To note**: Make sure this collection is the collection which is on the topmost of the hierarchy, means that it is the child of Scene Collection.

## Composing Scenes with Prefabs

Each of these prefab-enabled Collections can be composed into the main scene prefab to compose the overall map, the data within the collection poses no limit of usage.
